# Djouma
This is a project for Charitable Living, a website that partners with NGOs in order to help them raise money.

Our main method of helping raise money is by setting up Affiliate links in our website where people can access online shops form (e.g Amazon).
For every purchase made in those websites, we recieve a little commision, which we give, entirely, to the charity we are collaborating with 
at that point in time.

## Problem
Affileate accounts require that our site is some kind of blog where there are regular updates in order to cosider us as affiliates. But
we (us from Charitable Living, nor our partner NGOs) have the time to meet regularly in order to plan updates and write blog posts. Our partners are busy
saving the world, and we are current people with 9 to 5 jobs.

## Solution
This little program intends to solve that problem. Our partners can update us by sending a text meassage to a telegram bot, then at the end of every day
we run a little script that gets all the updates and posts them as blog entries in our site. This way our site becomes a Blog with regular updates (DAILY!!)
from our partners and we can continue as affiliates, and continue to help our partners raise funds.

We are making this publicly available so charities around the world or initiatives like ours can take it as an example and hopefully adapt it to their needs!

### God bless technology and God bless the Open Source community!!
